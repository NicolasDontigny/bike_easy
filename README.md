# Bike Eazy

Clone of Airbnb but for bikes. Created in 1 week in a team of 4 students to test rails as a team and prepare for the final project of the bootcamp.

Needs some refactoring and responsiveness. Feel free to give feedback :).

Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
